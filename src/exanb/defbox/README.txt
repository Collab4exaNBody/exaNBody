Using transformations (deformable box)
======================================

r : non transformed positions (grid/cell space)
force, acceleration and velocity : transformed (physical) space.

other quantities involved :
rcut[s] rcut_max and rcut_inc are expressed in physical space
nbh_dist is expressed in grid space
